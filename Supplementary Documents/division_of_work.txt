The work put in to create this project was divided up in the following ways for each group member:

[Matthew Ricci](https://github.com/mr4039) - Handled the front-end portion of the project; utilized the Bootstrap CSS/JS framework to create a more user-friendly navbar and to style the various forms across the project that are used to interact with the database; coded the script for generating a temporary password and emailing it to a user if the user has forgotten their password; wrote up and put together all supplementary materials for submission, summarizing how we solved all use cases and with what queries.

[Rasheeq Rahman](https://github.com/simpleandhappy) - Created the models found in models.py that are used by SQLAlchemy to build and interact with the database; commented the queries below their SQLAlchemy equivalents in core.py; implemented the search feature for groups and events; coded the back-end for the forms found on Register and Login; made enhancements to parts of the front-end; coded the features allowing a user to sign up for events as well as join a group.
